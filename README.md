# GESTRA API
A simple test atempting to build a REST api in Go. This is the first thing I've
written in Go.

## Usage
- Download and install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- `git clone https://github.com/SpaceLenore/Gestra.git`
- `go get github.com/gorilla/mux`
- `go run main.go`

## Config
You can change the port (currently 8080) in the file `main.go`
Change the variable named port


## What does Gestra stand for?
Good Question! Take your pick from the list or figure out a meaning yourself  
`Go-based Educational Simple Troublesome REST API`  
`Gestra: Easy Sample To REST API:s`  
`Google Evicts Someone Tomorrow, Rest Assured`

## Why?
Wanted to try Go, also gonna need a simple REST-API soon anyways
